## Crawler Details

By default, only the homepage URL is required. The actor will auto-discover links on your site, pausing for a random interval of 1-5 seconds between actions. Specify the number of loops if you wish to crawl the website/links multiple times.

The crawler operates as per your specifications and halts automatically post completion. Specify a timeout in the Run Options if you wish to stop the crawler after a fixed duration.
